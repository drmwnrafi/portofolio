I applied the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for Point to Line Iterative Closest Point (PLICP) and developed occupancy grid mapping from scratch using NumPy. Additionally, I built a web application for mobile robot control, integrating it seamlessly with Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) to enhance functionality and user interaction.

I reimplemented the code from the paper “WyNDA: A Method to Discover Mathematical Models of Dynamical Systems from Data” and developed both Python and C++ implementations to extract mathematical models of dynamical systems from observational data.

I implemented minimum snap trajectory optimization for both position and orientation, as well as geometric control on 
$SE(3)$ for nonlinear control in non-flat spaces. Additionally, I built a 3D simulation environment using MuJoCo to test and validate these control strategies.
